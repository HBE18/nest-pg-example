# Example CRUD API with NestJS and PostgreSQL without any ORM

## Description

This example uses a mock database from [UIBakery](https://uibakery.io/sql-playground) which does not have primary keys on their tables. That's why we dont use any ORM. Project is experimental and WIP. If you find any bug create a issue. All contribitions are welcome.
